## Design Principles

The system design follows these core principles:

1. **Swarm Intelligence**: Research conducted by parallel specialized agents, not a single monolithic agent
2. **Dynamic Adaptation**: Quality gates and criteria evolve based on learning
3. **Tool-First Development**: Metric tools are developed and validated before R&D begins
4. **Systematic Validation**: Comprehensive testing at every level
5. **Session Continuity**: Full state preservation for cross-session development
6. **Human Oversight**: Human-in-the-loop at critical decision points

## Design Review Summary

A comprehensive design review was conducted identifying 10 categories of gaps and improvements. All critical issues have been addressed in the revised design. See [DESIGN_REVIEW.md](DESIGN_REVIEW.md) for full details.
