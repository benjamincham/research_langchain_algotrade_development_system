# Decision Log

This document tracks all significant design and implementation decisions for the Research LangChain AlgoTrade Development System.

## Decision Format

| ID | Date | Decision | Rationale | Status |
|----|------|----------|-----------|--------|
| D-021 | 2026-01-18 | Experiment Tracking System for Trajectory Analysis | Designed comprehensive experiment tracking system to enable LLM to analyze improvement trajectories and determine if iterations are converging. System has 4 layers: (1) ExperimentLogger records every iteration to JSONL file with full context (code, parameters, metrics, actions), (2) TrajectoryAnalyzer computes statistical metrics (improvement rates, convergence status, gradient direction, distance to goal), (3) LLMTrajectoryAnalyzer uses powerful LLM to interpret patterns and recommend next actions, (4) Visualization generates charts. Tracks metric histories, parameter impact, iteration efficiency. LLM analyzes: convergence assessment, gradient effectiveness, parameter sensitivity, success likelihood. Enables intelligent decisions like 'continue iterating' vs 'pivot to research' vs 'abandon'. Integrates with failure analysis system (D-020) and feedback loops (D-019). Provides complete audit trail of all experiments. | Approved |
| D-020 | 2026-01-18 | LLM-Powered Failure Analysis System | Designed intelligent failure analysis system using LLM deep reasoning to diagnose strategy failures and recommend next actions. System classifies failures into 5 categories: (1) Parameter Issue - logic sound, needs tuning, (2) Algorithm Bug - implementation errors like incorrect RSI calculation, (3) Design Flaw - missing regime awareness or other fundamental design issues, (4) Research Gap - insufficient or incorrect research findings, (5) Fundamental Impossibility - alpha doesn't exist. LLM performs 6-step analysis: data collection, classification, root cause analysis, statistical assessment, decision recommendation, confidence scoring. Uses powerful LLM (GPT-4/Claude) with comprehensive context (code, metrics, history, research). Returns structured JSON with specific actionable recommendations. Confidence scoring enables human review for uncertain cases. Integrates with three-tier feedback loop to route failures intelligently. | Approved |
| D-019 | 2026-01-18 | Three-Tier Feedback Loop System | Designed comprehensive feedback loop system with three tiers: (1) Strategy Refinement Loop (max 5 iterations) for tactical fixes, (2) Research Refinement Loop (max 3 iterations) for strategic pivots back to research phase, (3) Abandonment Decision for futile research directions. System uses failure pattern analysis to route between tiers. Tier 1 handles parameter/logic issues. Tier 2 triggers when 3+ strategies fail consistently, indicating bad research direction. Tier 3 abandons after 15 total iterations or when fundamental impossibility detected. Includes state management schema and clear routing rules. | Approved |
| D-018 | 2026-01-18 | Phase 1 Core Infrastructure Complete | Successfully completed Phase 1 with all functional objectives met. Implemented LLM credentials management (5 providers), LLM client factory functions with LangChain's with_fallbacks(), comprehensive error handling system (7 exception classes), configuration management (.env.example), and integration tests (12 test cases). All 57 tests passing (45 unit + 12 integration). Test-to-code ratio: 1.07:1. Ready for Phase 2. | Approved |
| D-017 | 2026-01-17 | Comprehensive Project Review and Development Plan | Conducted full project review with 10-phase development plan, passing criteria, and functional objectives for each phase. Established clear metrics, timelines, and risk assessment. Current priority: Complete Phase 1 (LLM routing) within 2 days. Total estimated timeline: 8 weeks (37.5 days). | Approved |
| D-016 | 2026-01-17 | Use LangChain's Built-in with_fallbacks() Method | Instead of creating a custom RoutedChatModel, use LangChain's built-in with_fallbacks() method for multi-provider failover. This is simpler (~100 lines vs ~500), better maintained, and follows LangChain best practices. Our role is limited to credential management and convenient factory functions. | Approved |
| D-015 | 2026-01-17 | Provider-Agnostic LLM Routing System | Implement a unified LLM interface with automatic failover across multiple providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq, etc.). All credentials managed via environment variables with no hard-coding. Supports fallback, cost-optimized, and dynamic routing strategies for maximum reliability and flexibility. | Approved |
| D-014 | 2026-01-17 | Removed Regime-Aware Quality Gates Design | Removed the regime-aware quality gates feature as it violates the principle of objective evaluation. Algorithms must prove they can handle various market conditions through their own design, not through lowered quality standards. | Approved |
| D-013 | 2026-01-17 | Algorithm-Owned Regime Awareness | Quality gates remain objective and universal. Trading algorithms are responsible for their own regime awareness and adaptation. Quality gates evaluate whether the algorithm successfully demonstrates regime-adaptive behavior, not adjust standards based on market conditions. | Approved |
| D-012 | 2026-01-17 | Regime-Based Dynamic Threshold Adjustment | Adjust quality gate thresholds based on detected market regime to provide context-aware evaluation and reduce false positives/negatives. | Approved |
| D-011 | 2026-01-17 | Three-Tier Hierarchical Synthesis Architecture | Implement Domain Synthesizers as Tier 2 to pre-process findings before Leader synthesis, reducing cognitive load and improving accuracy. | Approved |
| D-010 | 2026-01-17 | Interactive Review Gates | Increase transparency and allow for human steering during the R&D process. | Approved |
| D-009 | 2026-01-17 | Branch-based Research Lineage | Better manage complex research paths using a Git-like branching model. | Approved |
| D-008 | 2026-01-17 | Backtest Engine Abstraction | Future-proof the system and allow for multiple backtesting engines. | Approved |
| D-007 | 2026-01-17 | Regime-Aware Quality Gates | Improve relevance of quality scores by anchoring them to market conditions. | Approved |
| D-006 | 2026-01-17 | Hierarchical Synthesis | Reduce cognitive load on Leader Agent and improve synthesis accuracy by having subagents pre-synthesize findings. | Approved |
| D-005 | 2026-01-17 | Pivot to Design Critique | User requested immediate stop of implementation to focus on design review and critique. | Approved |
| D-001 | 2026-01-17 | Use LangGraph for orchestration | Need for complex, cyclic workflows and state management. | Approved |
| D-002 | 2026-01-17 | Use ChromaDB for memory | Lightweight, local, and sufficient for vector-based retrieval. | Approved |
| D-003 | 2026-01-17 | 4-Stage Code Validation | Ensures safety and reliability of LLM-generated trading code. | Approved |
| D-004 | 2026-01-18 | Establish Decision-Tracking Hooks | Ensure all R&D progress and pivots are documented for continuity. | Proposed |

## Decision Details

### D-004: Establish Decision-Tracking Hooks
**Context**: The project requires seamless continuation across sessions and clear documentation of R&D pivots.
**Decision**: Implement a "Decision Hook" system where any significant change in direction or architecture must be recorded in this log before implementation.
**Impact**: Improved transparency, easier handoffs between agents, and better historical context for design choices.
